# About
This project is a poursuite of the project initiated by Baas Simon & Meinas Julien in collaboration with the CRISTAL Laboratory using TensorFlow, for more information on their project: 
https://github.com/simonbaas-gif/PJI-BAAS-MEINAS

it is mainly based on the research article of Cam2BEV: Transforming Camera Images to a Semantically Segmented Bird's Eye View
link: https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/Cam2BEV

The goal is to compute semantically segmented(SS) BEV images using synthetic data from simulation.
The inputs are SS-ed images from vehicle-mounted cameras.
The desired output is SS-ed image in Bird's-eye-view.
